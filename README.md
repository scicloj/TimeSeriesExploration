# Sci-Cloj time series exploration

## Purpose

The sci-cloj group is investigating the available tools in the Clojure scientific computing
ecosystem for doing time series analysis.

We are beginning by doing a bottom-up effort and transliterating the [Python for Data Science
Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.11-working-with-time-series.html)
to Clojure to see what we are missing.

## Contributing

To suggest improvements, please create an issue.
Pull requests are welcome as a form of discussion for enhancing the specification.

## License

MIT for now, but this is basically a placeholder.  Open to suggestions.
